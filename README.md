# How to create your articles

This guide will help you create articles using Markdown syntax. And how to create the correct file structure for your articles to be displayed correctly on the website.

## File structure

Your article should be placed in the `articles` folder. Inside this folder, create (IF NOT EXISTS) a new folder with your GitHub username (e.g., `gabriel-logan`). Inside your folder, create or edit a Markdown file (e.g., `example1.md`).

The file structure should look like this:

```bash
/articles/gabriel-logan/example1.md
```

After that, you can proceed to make a pull request to add your article to the repository.

Your article will be automatically imported and displayed on the website.
Url: https://gabriel-logan.github.io/community-articles/articles/gabriel-logan/example1

## Rules for writing articles

- Use Markdown syntax for formatting your article.
- You can only add or edit files in your own folder (YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME).
- Do not edit or delete files in other users' folders.
- Make sure your article is relevant to the community and follows the guidelines.

## How to change an article that is not yours

You can only edit or delete files in your own folder (YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME). If you want to suggest changes to an article that is not yours, you can create an issue or contact the author directly.
